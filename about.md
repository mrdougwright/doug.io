With the goal of having one single repository for all my web efforts, I created this simple site using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  
I'm a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none. I know how to play guitar, write code and optimize in the marketing world. I'm also a filmmaker, writer, philosopher, a dreamer...my curiosity hasn't killed me yet so I strive to keep learning.
